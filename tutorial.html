                    There is always a rule when it comes to buying a next car. <mark style="background-color: greenyellow">Do not ever buy a new car. Always
                    buy a pre-owned car.</mark> The reason why people want to avoid purchasing new cars is to avoid
                    the depreciation of the vehicle. However, it is hard to tell through words. What's wrong with a new car? Let's see one of the example
                    to demonstrate how depreciation works on certain cars. As an example, we will be using M5 model from BMW.

                    The above data table demonstrates how fast the BMW M5 model depreciate just for driving 10,000 miles. Within 10,000 miles, BMW M5
                    lost its value <mark style="background-color: rgb(204, 124, 124)">at least 20,000 dollars!</mark> If you ask around
                    why people don't really buy brand new BMW M5 from a dealership, that is the reason. People, as a consumer, don't want to
                    deal with the huge deprecation.

                    However, showing two tables like this does not really tell us the depreciation.
                    It is hard to capture depreciation using data tables also. So, let's display the data
                    in different ways.

                    What is the straight line in the graph?
                </div>
                <div>
                    The straight line is called linear regression model. Basically, gathering all the data (dots)
                    in the graph, linear regression model will draw a straight line that will show trend of the 
                    graph. This trend is basically demonstrates how much will it cost per one mile. However, this 
                    line itself is not useful. 
                    <mark style="background-color: rgba(255, 145, 0, 0.822)6, 156)">
                        This is just an ideal market where each mile will have fixed cost.
                    </mark>
                    As a consumer, we wish that there is no sudden depreciation and every car has a fixed depreciation rate per each mile.
                    Life would have been so much easier. But that's not the case as we saw in previous data for BMW M3 and M5 depreciation
                    data table. Now let's draw another line called depreciation line or logartihmic regression model.
                </div>
                <div id="chapter_4" style="font-size: 30px;">
                    What is the depreciation line?
                </div>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in <a href="#chapter_1">chapter 1</a> about the depreciation, car value depreciate in faster rate in 
                    the beginning of usage and slows in depreciation rate as you drive more. Let's draw this depreciation line along with 
                    the straight line we drawn before in <a href="#chapter_3">chapter 3</a>. If you check the graph above, there are two
                    lines that's been drawn. <a style="color: red">Red line</a> is the straight line that we mentioned as a linear regression
                    model. The <a style="color: steelblue">blue line</a> is a depreciation line. If you look at the depreciation line,
                    we notices that, in the beginning, the line goes straight down. A lot more slope than any other miles. This shows
                    how the depreciation rate is at highest for brand new cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you go towards 60,000 miles mark on the graph, you notice that the depreication line starts to become linear and less
                    slope. This tells us that the depreciation rate slows down as the car gets driven in a long term period. So the real question
                    is how these two lines combined together in one graph can bring insight to us?

                <div id="chapter_5" style="font-size: 30px;">

                                and <a style="color: red">straight line</a> meets. That is when depreciation rate starts to slow down. This meams that the vehicle
                                passed the huge depreciation rate phase. For example, BMW M5 biggest depreciation rate stops at 9000 miles with price around
                                88,000 dollars. This tells us that if you are interested in buying pre-owned cars, the best mileage will be to buy BMW M5,
                                in this case, at 9000 miles.

                                As a seller, the car already tanked the depreciation and lost the money. It's too late as a seller to recover the 
                                money that it losts from early depreciation. At first point, that's when seller can sell their cars since that's 
                                where most buyers are looking forward to. It will be easy to sell the car at that first point's price and miles.
                                Also if you already owned the vehicle before the first point, please try to sell before the first point meets or passes
                                to avoid losing money from depreication as much as possible.

                                Once the second point comes across, the vehicle pretty much is considered used and going through a phase where
                                things are going to break. There is a reason why the depreciation rate slowed down and becomes linear starting
                                 at that the second point.

                            As a buyer, you can buy the vehicle at first point and sell the vehicle at second point. This way, you are 
                            avoidiing the early sharp depreciation rate and sell the vehicle before maintenance becomes a problem.

                        We see that there are different insights from different perspective from buyers and sellers. But one graph can bring multiple insights
                        and it's pretty much up to the user to decide which sounds better for him or her.

                    AIFA doesn't force people to use our own analytic insights. AIFA can provide what we think its the best insight.
                    However, every insight is neither always right or always wrong. Depending on situation or in the market, some insights can be applied
                    in certain situation and some are not applicable. But at the end, we hope that people who use AIFA analysis, can create
                    their own insights and be aware of the market that he or she getting into.
