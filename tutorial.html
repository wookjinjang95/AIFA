                    buy a pre-owned car.</mark> The reason why people want to avoid purchasing new cars is to avoid
                    the depreciation of the vehicle. However, it is hard to tell through words. What's wrong with a new car? Let's see one of the example
                    to demonstrate how depreciation works on certain cars. As an example, we will be using M5 model from BMW.

                    The above data table demonstrates how fast the BMW M5 model depreciate just for driving 10,000 miles. Within 10,000 miles, BMW M5
                    lost its value <mark style="background-color: rgb(204, 124, 124)">at least 20,000 dollars!</mark> If you ask around
                    why people don't really buy brand new BMW M5 from a dealership, that is the reason. People, as a consumer, don't want to
                    deal with the huge deprecation.

                    But not all cars always have depreciation rate like this. Instead of looking at BMW M5 model, we are going to look into BMW M3 model.

                    However, showing two tables like this does not really tell us the depreciation.
                    It is hard to capture depreciation using data tables also. So, let's display the data
                    in different ways.
                </div>
                <div class="display-6" style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    BMW M3 Straight line Graph
                </div>

                <div class="display-6">
                    BMW M5 Straight line Graph
                </div>
                <div id="bmw_m5_depreciation" style="height: 600px;"></div>
                <div style="font-size: 30px;">
                    <section id="chapter_3"></section>
                    What is the straight line in the graph?
                </div>
                <div>
                    The straight line is called linear regression model. Basically, gathering all the data (dots)
                    in the graph, linear regression model will draw a straight line that will show trend of the 
                    graph. This trend is basically demonstrates how much will it cost per one mile. However, this 
                    line itself is not useful. 
                    <mark style="background-color: rgba(255, 145, 0, 0.822)6, 156)">
                        This is just an ideal market where each mile will have fixed cost.
                    </mark>
                    As a consumer, we wish that there is no sudden depreciation and every car has a fixed depreciation rate per each mile.
                    Life would have been so much easier. But that's not the case as we saw in previous data for BMW M3 and M5 depreciation
                    data table. Now let's draw another line called depreciation line or logartihmic regression model.
                </div>
                <div style="font-size: 30px;">
                    <section id="chapter_4"></section>
                    What is the depreciation line?
                </div>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in <a href="#chapter_1">chapter 1</a> about the depreciation, car value depreciate in faster rate in 
                    the beginning of usage and slows in depreciation rate as you drive more. Let's draw this depreciation line along with 
                    the straight line we drawn before in <a href="#chapter_3">chapter 3</a>.
